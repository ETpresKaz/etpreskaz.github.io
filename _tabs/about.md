## Who is Ethan Kazenske?

I am a 17 year old student who lives in the OKC metro area. Some of my passions include debate, mock trial, fly-fishing, and programming. My journey with programming started freshman year when I took a two week coding class. From there I started to learn more, with on and off learning and practice until summer of my junior year. I began taking several programming courses online, and taking on difficult challenges!

Some intrests of mine in the field of programming are:

* Python development

* Software development

* Data structers and algorithms

* Game development

Throughout my time programming, I have taken on different challenges to help further my knowledge about these topics. I also have many projects planned for the future, which I plan to document here!
